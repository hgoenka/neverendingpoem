		"Rule #3: This is not for promoting yourself or your propaganda, and so, if you must rant, do it elsewhere.",
		"Rule #4: The poem was started in English, so stick to that language.",
		"Rule #5: There is a limit of 80 characters in any one line.",
		"Rule #6: Any contributions not in line with the rules will be deleted."
